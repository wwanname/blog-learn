## My Experience with the Aeron Chair

I’ve been sitting on a chair from Herman Miller called
[Aeron Chair](https://amzn.to/3mzPwFZ) for more than 5 years now. You may know
this chair because it’s so popular around the world. I bought it at Rakuten
Ichiba.

Before switching, I was using a very cheap chair. Since making the switch, I
find myself less tired and more productive during long hours of sitting. The
Aeron Chair is extremely durable and has not shown any signs of wear or breakage
even after 5 years of constant use.

It's truly worth the `investment`. _Take care of your back!_
